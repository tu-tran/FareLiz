To get started, the main solution file is FareLiz.sln. Example implementations of the plugins can be found in Plugins folders of the solution.\r\n\r\n##Questions\r\nUse the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/tu-tran/FareLiz/issues) to create new inquiries/questions/bug reports/feature requests...\r\n\r\n##History\r\nThe project was implemented for personal use: it has been difficult to track down the airline ticket pricing mechanisms, and the existing services were not powerful enough: lack of data/lots of email spam/PAID services. Thus the project was initiated as a one-man project for the sake of simplifying the fare hunting process. As a frequent traveler, it is always easier to pick the annual travel time based on the the price chart from the previous years --> FareLiz was developed.\r\n\r\n##Contribute\r\nThis project is continuously evolving and any kind of help is greatly appreciated. You are more than welcome to get involved in the development of the project.","google":"UA-42750705-3","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
